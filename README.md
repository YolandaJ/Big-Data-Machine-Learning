# Artificial-Neural-Network-for-Car-Evaluation
This project built a ANN model to determine if a car is good or not with given parameters. 

What I have done are:
•	Constructed and trained a neural network to evaluate cars using dataset with 1728 instances, 6 features.
•	Optimized the ANN by preprocessing raw data with Pandas and Numpy, which cleaned, standardized, converted data to ensure good work with numeric and scaled data.
•	Applied backpropagation algorithm and replaced activation function sigmoid with ReLU to optimize the model, which improved accuracy to 98%.

How to run:
Use python to run ANN.py, the input is the processed data, which is car_processed.txt.
